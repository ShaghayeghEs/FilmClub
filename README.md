# Film Club
A joint project for Web Programming course, a social media based on movies using Django web framework.
It is a web application implemented using Python and Django where users would rate and review their favorite films, connect to their friends and read their reviews. 

Film Club is social media for movie fans. It doesn't have all the complexities of modern social medias like Facebook, because its features are trimmed down to the essentials. Nothing unnecessary is implemented and the user will feel right at home. Moreover it is not a mere database like IMDb and has lots of social features such as following other users and seeing their movie reviews in your timeline.
